Churn Analysis with Python, SQL, and Power BI
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn using Python for data processing, SQL for data storage and querying, and Power BI for visualization. Churn analysis helps businesses understand why customers leave and identify strategies to improve retention.

Tech Stack
Python (Data Cleaning, EDA, ML Model)
SQL (Database Queries, Data Storage)
Power BI (Data Visualization)
Project Workflow
Data Collection:
Data imported from CSV, databases, or APIs.
Data Cleaning (Python + SQL):
Handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting.
Storing cleaned data in a SQL database.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Python + SQL):
Identifying patterns using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Querying customer data for insights using SQL.
Churn Prediction Model (Python):
Applying Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.).
